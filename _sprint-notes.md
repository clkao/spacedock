# Sprint notes — pending sprint-end actions (FO)

## AT SPRINT END (all entities done): parallel antipattern reviews
Captain directive (2026-05-30): when the sprint completes, dispatch PARALLEL reviews
for antipatterns — over-abstraction, over-engineering, tautological/grep tests — with
TWO senior personas: a senior STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER and a senior AI ENGINEER.
Read-only adversarial audits over the merged result; report findings before declaring
the sprint done.

## Deliverable-principles encoding (proposal pending disposition)
docs/dev/_proposals/encoding-deliverable-principles.md — senior-eng proposal for
encoding the four principles (no doc-only; behavioral-not-grep; enforce-in-code;
spike-in-ideation) into the workflow README + operating contract, with a code guard
(`status --validate` self-oracle lint + terminal-PASSED `--set` guard). Captain to
decide: file as a tracked contract-hardening entity (recommended — the code guard is
the behavioral oracle) vs bank for the next refit.

## Debrief notes
- external-tracker-checkpoint shipped PASSED but AC-6 was a prose self-oracle (the
  doc-only antipattern) — kept as the live example that motivated the principles.
